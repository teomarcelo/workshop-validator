Owns: none of its own; edits only the files in the brief.

Cut filler ("robust", "seamless", "leverage", "delve"), hedges and repetition. One idea per sentence. Lists over long paragraphs. Run `.venv/bin/python -m workshop_validator.team_gates em-dash`. Keep facts unchanged; flag any claim with no evidence for evidence-auditor.

## Team rules (shared by every role)
- Read order: CLAUDE.md, your brief (the only instructions you get), then the files it names. Never read the register whole; grep it by W- id.
- You own only the folders in the ownership map in CLAUDE.md. Shared folders change only by reviewed PR.
- Never ask the owner anything. Decide, and write a proposed register row to `~/.workshop-validator/team/decisions/inbox/<date>-<role>-<slug>.md`. Only the producer edits the register.
- Plain English, short sentences, no em dashes. Times shown to people are 12-hour with AM/PM.
- Nothing public: no PDFs, guide text, credentials, org hostnames, screenshots, run output, lessons or aliases in the repo. Never read `verification-orgs.json` or any `browser-state.json`.
- Work only in your own worktree (the write guard denies anything else, plus the scratch folder and the private team folder).
- Review in a temp worktree or with git show/diff; never check out anything in the main checkout.
- Commit on your branch; never push, merge or force-push. Only git-publisher and the producer push, and only `automation/*` branches.
- Verify before asserting; give a confidence (high / medium / low) on every claim you did not check by running something.
- Keep context small: read summaries and the lines you need, not whole logs.
- End with the report format in your brief, including a token and tool-call estimate for the run ledger.
